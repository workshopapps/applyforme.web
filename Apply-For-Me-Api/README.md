- Service Implementation e.g. ApplierServiceImpl or EmailServiceImpl
- Repository e.g. ApplierRepository
- Repository Implementation e.g. ApplierRepositoryImpl

- Utility e.g. ApplierUtil or GlobalUtils
- Configuration e.g. SecurityConfig
- Exception e.g. ApplierNotFoundException or EmailAddressNotFoundException or EmailAddressExistsException

**Description**



- Controller class should be annotated with @RestController and @RequestMapping. The base mapping url of any controller should be the name of the entity they are creating a controller for. For instance, if you are creating an AuthenticationController, the base url should be @RequestMapping("/authentication") or @RequestMapping("/auth"). This class will contain HTTP Request handling logic.

- Service class should be annotated with @Service. This class will contain business related logic for Apply For me. Exceptions should be throwned in this classes.

- Repository class should be annotated with @Repository. This class will contain logic that relates to data persistence and management.

**Updates**
- JSON payload parameters or properties must be in lowercase and compound words should be separated by underscore.
- When sending a json payload like
```
    {
       "email_address": "info@applyforme.com"
       "date_of_birth": "2002-10-20"
    }
```

You can map this to a Java class using

```
    @Getter
    @Setter
    public class ContactMe {
        
        @JsonProperty("email_address")
        private String emailAddress;
        
        @JsonProperty("date_of_birth")
        private String date_of_birth;
    } 
```
