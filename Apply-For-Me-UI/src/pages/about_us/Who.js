                    Job hunting can be stressful and in most cases extremely
                     frustrating, don’t you think? We think so too, 
                     one could even describe it as a full-time job 
                     in itself; the filling of countless forms, 
                     enlisting your skill-set over and over again, 
                     having to retype why you think you are a good 
                     fit for the role, deciding a salary range…It never ends!
